# AstroCast
*An extended astronomer's forecast tool*

This is the repository for AstroCast. When it's done, you'll be able to use it to find the best day to go watching the sky in the next 10 days, taking into account weather, temperature, moon phase, and more!

---
AstroCast is currently in a pre-alpha development phase, far from even a functional prototype. You are free to peruse the code here, but note that there is still much to do before it is ready for general use.


*Note:*  This program uses the API Stormglass to retrieve its data, which requires a paid subscription. If you want to set up your own AstroCast instance, it will require you to get an API key from Stormglass and store it in the key.json file.
